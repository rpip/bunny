# Bunny

HTTP job processing service.

A job is a collection of tasks, where each task has a name and a shell command.
Tasks may depend on other tasks and require that those are executed beforehand.
The service takes care of sorting the tasks to create a proper execution order.

# How it works

Topologically sorts the nodes, and detects cycles using depth-first-search algorithm.

The core is in lib/bunny, separate from the web interface.

Error messages are meaningful and precise to catch and report many edges cases:

  - self reference tasks/nodes
  - cycles / loop in tasks: e.g: A -> B -> A -> B, A -> B -> C -> B
  - missing / dead references
    - detect all cycles and include them in the error message.

Uses ETS tables to collect found cycles and track the state of the search.

## Examples

### Sort and return JSON

``` shell
$ curl -d @test/fixtures/many_valid.json http://localhost:4000
[
  {
    "command": "touch /tmp/file1",
    "name": "task-1"
  },
  {
    "command": "echo 'Hello World!' > /tmp/file1",
    "name": "task-3"
  },
  {
    "command": "cat /tmp/file1",
    "name": "task-2"
  },
  {
    "command": "rm /tmp/file1",
    "name": "task-4"
  }
]
```

### Sort task and serialize to shell script
``` shell
$ curl -d @test/fixtures/many_valid.json http://localhost:4000/sh
#!/usr/bin/env bash
touch /tmp/file1
echo 'Hello World!' > /tmp/file1
cat /tmp/file1
rm /tmp/file1
```

## How to run

### Run with docker

``` shell
$ docker-compose up
```

You can also directly build the image and run the container

### Release

``` shell
$ mix release
Î» _build/dev/rel/bunny/bin/bunny console
Erlang/OTP 20 [erts-9.1.2] [source] [64-bit] [smp:4:4] [ds:4:4:10] [async-threads:10] [hipe] [kernel-poll:false] [dtrace]

Interactive Elixir (1.8.0) - press Ctrl+C to exit (type h() ENTER for help)
iex(bunny@127.0.0.1)>
```

### Deploy locally

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
